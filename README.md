# 6 Cell Lithium Polymer Charger
The objective of the project was to develop a 6-cell Lithium Polymer battery charger using a
Texas Instruments MSP430FR6989 Development board for the charging algorithm.

## Description
The Texas InstrumentsMSP430 microcontroller facilitated the safety requirements by employing a custom battery
charging algorithm based upon both user-defined fault conditions as well as default current and voltage thresholds.
The charging algorithm employed by the MSP430 enabled efficient data processing from a multitude of analog
inputs including individual cell voltages, battery pack temperature, and the current supplied to the battery. 
With the use of Dataforth Corporationâ€™s industry-leading 8B47T-07 analog signal conditioning modules, such that our battery pack
temperature measurements have a greater depth of accuracy.
